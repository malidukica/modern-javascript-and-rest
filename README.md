# Modern JavaScript and REST

This workshop focuses on the new language constructs in the latest version of JavaScript known as ECMAScript2015 or ECAMScript 6. We'll look at what problems these things solve, and also build something against a server-side REST based API. 

This workshop also covers more of working with web development in a browser development console and inspecting web traffic with Fiddler or Postman (chrome plugin).

This repository contains a link to a Google Presentation and three exercises.

## How to get started
* Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer. If you've never used git before, you can alternatively use the the "Download ZIP" button to the right.
* Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer, it's easier to read it on GitHub with formatting. We therefore recommend you keep a web browser tab open with the exercise tasks.
* Open [exercise 1](./exercise1/README.md/).
* Remember to ask an instructor if you're stuck.
